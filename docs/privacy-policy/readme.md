## Privacy Policy

This is a placeholder privacy policy that will be replaced with a real one before the first public release of **Android Infinite**.

1. We will never track, store, share your personal data in any way shape or form.
1. However we have no control over what Google decides to do, so please be aware of this.
1. Android Infinite requires you to sign in using a Google Play account - otherwise progress will be lost, and the leaderboards feature will not work. What Google does with your account is outside of our control, so again, please be aware of this.
